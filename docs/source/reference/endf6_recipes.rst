ENDF-6 Recipes
==============

endf-parserpy relies on ENDF-6 recipes to
read, write and interpret ENDF-6 formatted data.
Therefore, in order to understand the
capabilities of endf-parserpy, it is sufficient
to understand the ENDF-6 recipes and
:ref:`how they induce a mapping between
ENDF-6 formatted data and Python dictionaries <endf6_recipe_sec>`.
The ENDF-6 recipes are all located in the ``endf_parserpy/endf_recipes``
folder of endf-parserpy's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/iaea-nds/endf-parserpy>`_.
