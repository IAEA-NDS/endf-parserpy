math_utils
==========

The ``endf_parserpy.utils.math_utils`` module implements
functions for basic mathematical operations on scalars
and iterable objects (e.g. :class:`list`). Operations
applied to two iterable objects are performed element-wise.
Operations between a scalar and an iterable object are also
performed element-wise.
The :class:`~end_parserpy.EndfFloat` class
stores a :class:`float` along with its string representation.

The following facilities are provided by the ``math_utils`` module:
