class EndfParserCpp:
    """Class for parsing and writing ENDF-6 formatted data.

    This class provides functions for (1) parsing ENDF-6 formatted
    data, and (2) converting data given in a :class:`dict` object
    into the ENDF-6 format.
    The ENDF-6 formatted data may be given in a text file, a string
    or a list of strings containing the individual lines. The essential
    methods of this class are :func:`parsefile` and :func:`writefile`.

    This class closely mirrors the functionality of the
    :class:`~endf_parserpy.endf_parser.EndfParser` class but relies
    on compiled functions for parsing and writing. Tests indicated
    that these functions are usually at least 50x faster than the
    corresponding functions in the
    :class:`~endf_parserpy.endf_parser.EndfParser` class and in some
    cases several hundred times faster.

    Please note that this class may not be usable if the compilation
    of the C++ module codes failed during package installation. Further
    note that most but not all options of the
    :class:`~endf_parserpy.endf_parser.EndfParser` class
    are implemented in this class.

        """Initializaton of options for parsing and writing ENDF-6 data.

        The process of parsing can be influenced by many options that
        determine how inconsistencies in ENDF-6 formatted data should be
        handled and the degree of flexibility in accepting unusual
        number representations. Parameters pertaining to the parsing process
        are indicated by `(parsing)` in their description.
        The reverse process, writing data into the ENDF-6 format, can also be
        influenced by a variety of options, e.g., impacting the output precision.
        Parameters related to converting data into the ENDF-6 format are
        marked by `(writing)`.


        Parameters
        ------------------
        ignore_number_mismatch: bool
            Tolerate mismatches between numbers in ENDF-6 formatted
            data and the expected numbers according to the ENDF-6 recipes.
            *(parsing)*
        ignore_zero_mismatch: bool
            Tolerate non-zero numbers in ENDF-6 formatted data that
            are required to be zero according to ENDF-6 recipes.
            *(parsing)*
        ignore_varspec_mismatch: bool
            Tolerate distinct numbers that are supposed to be mapped
            to the same symbol name. For the time being, even with this
            option enabled, possible inconsistent variable assignment
            have to be marked with a queston mark in the ENDF-6 recipe.
            *(parsing)*
        accept_spaces: bool
            Eliminate spaces in a number before trying to parse it, e.g.
            `1.234 +8` is transformed to `1.234+8`. *(parsing)*
        ignore_blank_lines: bool
            If `True`, skip blank lines in ENDF-6 formatted input without
            complaining. Otherwise, blank lines will lead to parsing failure.
            *(parsing)*
        ignore_send_records: bool
            If `True`, the correct positioning of SEND/FEND/MEND/TEND
            to indicate the end of a section is not checked. *(parsing)*
        ignore_missing_tpid: bool
            If `True`, the parser will tolerate a missing TPID
            record at the beginning of the file. *(parsing)*
        abuse_signpos: bool
            Permit positive numbers to start in the first character slot
            of an ENDF-6 field, which is usually reserved for the sign,
            to enhance numerical precision. *(writing)*
        keep_E : bool
            If `true`, include the `e` character in scientific notation,
            e.g. `1.23e-8` instead of `1.23-8`. The inclusion establishes
            compatibility with programming languages different from Fortran
            while the omission enhances numerical precision. *(writing)*
        skip_intzero: bool
            For numbers written out in decimal notation, eliminate
            the integer part if zero, e.g. `0.12` becomes `.12` to
            increase attainable precision. *(writing)*
        prefer_noexp: bool
            Switch to decimal representation (i.e. non-scientific) if it leads
            to an increase of accuracy, e.g. `1.234567-1` becomes `0.12345678`.
            *(writing)*
        endf_format : str
            Allow the user to pick specific ENDF format flavors.
            The default `endf6-ext` tolerates deviations from the
            ENDF-6 format encountered in some nuclear data libraries.
            Other choices are `endf6` for strict compliance with the
            ENDF-6 formats manual and `jendl` with JENDL specific
            conventions, which are also implemented in `endf6-ext`.

        exclude : Union[None, tuple[Union[int, tuple[int, int]]]]
            MF/MT sections to exclude in the parsing process.
            Excluded sections will only be available as a list of strings.
            The default `None` indicates that nothing should be excluded.
            If a `tuple` is provided, integers in that tuple denote the
            `MF` sections to be excluded. In addition to integers,
            also tuples composed of two integers can be provided to
            indicate the `MF`/`MT` combinations that should be excluded.
            For instance, ``(3,)`` would exclude MF section 3 and
            ``(3, (2, 151))`` would exclude MF section 3 and additionally
            MF=2/MT=151.
            Useful to speed up the parsing process or to ensure
            a verbatim copy of data in a read/write sequence.
        include : Union[None, tuple[Union[int, tuple[int, int]]]]
            The MF/MT section to include in the parsing.

            A nested dictionary. The keys of the first level are
