# var ZA:   ZA = (1000.0 * Z) + A
#           Z ... charge number of material
#           A ... mass number of material
#
# var AWR:  ratio of the mass of the material to that of the neutron
#
# var JP:   An integer that is “overloaded” to provide information about
#           both prompt fission neutrons and photons. When not storing fission
#           observables, set JP=0.
#           JP=JPP*10+JPN where JPP and JPN are flags for photons and neutrons
#           respectively. The flags JPP and JPN take values 0, 1 or 2.
#           For JPX=JPN or JPP:
#
#               - JPX=0  This indicates that the usual MF=6 interpretation
#                        of yi and fi holds.
#
#               - JPX=1  This indicates the probability functions P̃i (ν, E)
#                        for each particle i are given in the spot reserved
#                        for the particle yields yi. In this case, fi is
#                        not given explicitly in MF=6 as is indicated by the
#                        LAW flag. P̃i(ν, E) is the probability of emitting ν
#                        particles of type i divided by the average
#                        multiplicity of particle i as a function of energy.
#
#               - JPX=2  This indicates that only the probability functions
#                        and individual spectra are given. In this case, yi
#                        stores the probability functions P̃i(ν, E), and
#                        fi stores the average spectrum for the ν particles
#                        of type i.
#
#           Note, when JP>0, the LAW values may take unusual, negative,
#           values. In such cases the format is equal to LAW=0, giving only
#           the incident energy-dependent probability table. See the definition
#           of LAW below and Section 6.3.9 for further discussion.
#
# var LCT:  Reference system for secondary energy and angle (incident energy
#           is always given in the LAB system).
#
#               - LCT=1  laboratory (LAB) coordinates used for secondary
#                        energy and angle for all reaction products;
#
#               - LCT=2  center-of-mass (CM) system used for secondary energy
#                        and angle for all reaction products;
#
#               - LCT=3  LCT=3 center-of-mass system for both angle and
#                        secondary energy for light particles (A≤ 4) and
#                        laboratory system for heavy recoils (A>4).
#
#               - LCT=4  center-of-mass system for initial reaction products,
#                        and laboratory system for any subsequent breakup
#                        products. Intended for use with breakup reactions
#                        (see section 0.4.3.4).
#
# var NK:   Number of subsections in this section (MT). Each subsection
#           describes one reaction product. There can be more than one
#           subsection for a given particle or residual nucleus (see LIP).
#           For the limit on NK see Appendix G.
#
# var subsection/*/ZAP:
#           Product identifier 1000 ∗ Z + A with Z = 0 for photons and
#           A = 0 for electrons and positrons. A section with A = 0 can also
#           be used to represent the average recoil energy or spectrum for an
#           elemental target (see text).
#
# var subsection/*/AWP:
#           Product mass in neutron units. When ZAP=0, this field can contain
#           the energy of a primary photon. In that case, this section will
#           contain an angular distribution (LAW=2) for the primary photon.
#
# var subsection/*/LIP:
#           Product modifier flag.
#
#           *Isomeric states*: Its main use is to identify the isomeric state
#           of a product nucleus. In this case, LIP=0 for the ground state,
#           LIP=1 for the first isomeric state, etc. These values should be
#           consistent with LISO in File 8, MT=457.
#
#           *Multiple emission*: In some cases, it may be useful to use LIP
#           to distinguish between different subsections with the same value of
#           ZAP for light particles. For example, LIP=0 could be the first
#           neutron out for a sequential reaction, LIP=1 could be the second
#           neutron, and so on. Other possible uses might be to indicate which
#           compound system emitted the particles, or to distinguish
#           between the neutron from the (n,np) channel and that from the
#           (n,pn) channel. The exact meaning assigned to LIP should be
#           explained in the File 1, MT=451 comments.
#
#           *Fission*: LIP may be used to denote which particle out of
#           ν particles the current set describes. See Section 6.3.9 for
#           further discussion.
#
# var subsection/*/LAW:
#           Flag to distinguish between different representations of the
#           distribution function, fi :
#
#              LAW=0  unknown distribution;
#              LAW=1  continuum energy-angle distribution;
#              LAW=2  two-body reaction angular distribution;
#              LAW=3  isotropic two-body distribution;
#              LAW=4  recoil distribution of a two-body reaction;
#              LAW=5  charged-particle elastic scattering;
#              LAW=6  n-body phase-space distribution; and
#              LAW=7  laboratory angle-energy law.
#              LAW<0  (For Fission only with JP>0) the average particle
#                     distributions are given in MF=4/5 (for neutrons) or
#                     MF=14/15 (for photons). The format here is equivalent
#                     to LAW=0, giving only the incident energy-dependent
#                     probability table. See Sections 6.2.1 and 6.3.9 for
#                     further discussion.
