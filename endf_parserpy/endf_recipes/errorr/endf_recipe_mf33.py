ENDF_RECIPE_MF33 = """
# MF33 recipe for and ERRORR covariance tape (file) prepared using NJOY2016.
# MF33/MT is used to specify the group averaged covariance matrix.

# var MAT:  Material number
# var MT:   Reaction number according to ENDF conventions
# var ZA:   ZA = (1000.0 * Z) + A = ZA number
#           Z ... charge number of material
#           A ... mass number of material
# var AWR:  Ratio of the mass of the material to that of the neutron
# var MTL:  Non-zero value of MTL is used as a flag to indicate that reaction MT is
#           one component of the evaluator-defined lumped reaction MTL, as discussed
#           in paragraphs at the end of Section 33.2 and 33.3 below; in this case, no
#           covariance information subsections are given for reaction MT and NL=0.
# var NK:   Number of sections (MAT,MT; MAT1,MT1)
#
# var subsection/*/MAT1:      MAT number of the second reaction in the pair
# var subsection/*/MT1:       MT number of the second reaction in the pair
# var subsection/*/NG:        Number of energy groups
# var subsection/*/NG1[i]:    Number of consecutive energy groups for reaction MT1 of MAT1
#                             for which covariances will be given explicitly
# var subsection/*/IG1[i]:    Initial energy group index for reaction MT1 of MAT1
# var subsection/*/IG[i]:     Energy group index of reaction MT of MAT
# var subsection/*/COV[i,j]:  Covariance between the energy group IG[i] of (MAT,MT) and
#                             the energy group IG1[j] of (MAT1,MT1)

# The entry MAT1=0 is a flag to indicate that MAT1=MAT.
# The last row of the covariance matrix is always given explicitly, even if
# it does contain only zeros. The occurrence of the last row terminates a
# given covariance matrix and signals that the next card (line) will name a
# new reaction pair.
